The recipe of making Maggi is first filling water (as much as you want) in the bowl, then, add the maggi you get in the packet, let it boil and become hot for sometime, after you see that this has been done, you take out the maggi masala from the packet and put it in the maggi (one or two packs). After doing this, you mix and stirr it with an instrument and let it boil and cook proerly for at least 5 minutes and after you think it is done and the colour looks fine, you take the maggi and put in the bowl you would eat it in. And you finally get to taste and eat what you have made!
